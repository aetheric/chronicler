# Chronicler

A live-action roleplaying campaign manager, designed to assist storytellers in writing, promoting, and running their games with as little fuss as possible.

## Application Modules

The application is comprised of several distinct modules, each providing the user with a useful set of functionality that makes running and playing in a LARP campaign easier to handle.

### Public

All promotional material for the application, campaigns running in it, and affiliate sites is managed and presented here. This is the only public-facing part of the site, requiring no registration or login to function.

### Account

Here is where users can manage their profile, connected OpenID accounts, payment information (for subscriptions), and see both their activity on the application, and any notifications they need to respond to.

### Campaign

Here is where a user can see all the information and actions for available campaigns. Users should be able to scroll through the list of available campaigns and join ones they wish, subsequently submitting character concepts, and managing their knowledge and communications within the game.

### Storyteller

This is where a user can create and manage their own campaign settings, information, and promotional material.

### Actions

Between games, characters typically have downtime in which to perform all manner of actions in the setting. This section of the application makes managing these downtime actions a breeze. Players can submit actions, set resolution preferences, and see the results of their virtual labours.

### Characters

This section simply manages the character sheets of a player's various characters. It allows them to track stats and perform advancement.

### Knowledge

Managing setting information, character backstory, rules and plots is a pain without a good way of tracking changes, collaboratively editing, and cross-referencing. This section should also allow for secret and false information to be managed in a more efficient manner as well.

### Communication

Keeping in touch with players, roleplaying with characters, and discussing items in the knowledge base is what this module is designed to do. Instead of using a standard forum approach, discussions are linked by the references and relations they have, making for a more organic and natural method of communication.

### Administrative

Not accessible by anyone but application administrators and moderators, this section is for tracking the running of the app, moderating new and existing campaigns, and maintaining the running of the application as a whole.
